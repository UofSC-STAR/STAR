hello kind friends...

I see you are reading this...

that's great...

you most likely want to stop now...

this file is just a file with some stupid text so that I can be lazy and not fix my terrible code...

what is terrible about it...

glad you asked...

so when I started writting this program I assumed this obnoxious folder structure...

to add to that somewhere I thought... 

hey it would nice to the user if there was only one file of code so they don't get scared by a bunch of files...

like they weren't already afraid of all the friggin folders I made them have...

but now it would be more trouble then it's worth to go through that thousand plus lines of code to fix the stupid folder structure...

and so why does writting this stupid file help out...

another great question...

it allows me to easily upload to git-hub so that the folder structure is there when really I just use it to make temporary files...

what's even funnier I learned python already has protocols for creating temporary files so really it was all for not...

anyways that's all I really have to say...

well at least in this stupid folder
