learning goals
these are the questions
any further questions
pause to reflect
for problem one
linear equation
rational equation
for problem two 
any examples
we will do a few examples
we will do a couple of examples
is the angle on the unit circle
can we find an angle
what is sine
what is the sine
what is cosine
what is the cosine of forty-five degrees
convert to radians
convert to polar coordinates
section one point three
what is the highest power of ex
can we solve for ex
multiply both sides of the equation
both sides of the equation
the left side of the equation
the right side of the equation
is there more than one solution
tangent of the angle
cotangent of the angle
the inverse function
the trigometric function
the exponential function
is this an exponential function
does this equation make sense
does our answer make sense
are there any questions on problem one
what is the sign of the function
is this function odd or even
absolute value functions
the first page
pass back the 
any questions on the test
any questions on the quiz
what happened to our variable
what happened to ex
how do we know this is the only solution
is this the only solution
multiply by a fraction
divide by a fraction
add two fractions
subtract two fractions
subrtact from both sides of the equation
add to both side of the equation
what ever we do to one side of the equation we must do to the other
distribute the three
distribute the two 
can we distribute
can we factor the polynomial
factoring is a good first step
what is the first step
what is the next step
how do we know 
how did you know
how do solve this equation
how do we do this problem
did someone try to do this problem another way
is there another way to do this problem
is this our final answer
how do we know this polynomial 
plug in 
plug in your solution
check your answer
don't forget to check your answer
what is theta
what is are
integration by parts
divide by five
the fractions are
when you solve you get this
when you solve
what do you get when
multiply by
factoring works 
how do you solve a quadratic equation
how do you know what to do next
what is the quadratic formula
we use the quadratic formula
how did you know to use the quadratic formula
now we have a negative
what does a negative in the exponent mean
what is the exponent
then you plug it in here
multiply by
divide by
add to
subtract from
work one side of the equation at a time
who remembers absolute value
how to find the absolute value
a piece-wise function
we are splitting 
there are two branches
how do we use that
solve a problem like
good strategy
what startegy did you use
where is sign positive
where tangent positive
where is tangent negative 
solve for each
there is another type of equation
what type of equation is this
can we change this equation
is that our final answer
any questions at all
the questions help you learn
it is a question which will 
when you have a question 
with a question
and a question
why would a question scare you
clarifying the point
for a point of clarification
this point needs to be clarified 
to clarify the last thing
that needs to be clarified
that needs some help of clarification
this question could help you later
this is a good question
this is a question
this is for clarification

these are all good questions
for another question
is that another question
does anyone need me to clarify
wait a moment to answer
do not answer right away and wait for questions
I ask that you wait for your questions
wait a moment
wait for your other students to think about their answers
wait a moment 
everyone think about this question
think through the question
wait for a question
waiting for enough time to pass
questions waiting clarify
question clarification wait
that wait

that question
this questions
need more questions
looking for the right question
waiting for some more questions
questions help clarify
should have many questions
should pause for clarification
should wait for questions
questions are all
questions are education
questions are learning 
that is questions
those are really good questions
really good question
well worded question
questions can be good
questions are always good
waiting for questions
sometimes you should wait
